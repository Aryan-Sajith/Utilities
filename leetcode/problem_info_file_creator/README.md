<h2>LeetCode Problem README Creator</h2>

<h4>This program intakes a LeetCode question URL and desired
file directory to automatically create a README.md file which
displays the problem name, difficulty, and content format from
LeetCode's website. It's made for Safari because I'm on
a macbook right now.</h4>
